                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part, the simians of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys.Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys of Catarrhini.</p>
                    <p>Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean the Cercopithecoidea or the Catarrhini.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers. A group of monkeys may be commonly referred to as a tribe or a troop.

                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen F4, right to the amphitheatre.</p>
