                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas (both critically endangered), and either four or five subspecies. They are the largest living primates</p>
                    <p>The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.</p>
                    <p>It is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were what we now call gorillas, another species of ape or monkeys, or humans.The closest relatives of gorillas are the other two Homininae genera, chimpanzees and humans, all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about 7 million years ago

                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen D12, right to the amphitheatre.</p>
